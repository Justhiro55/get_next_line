In this project, you will grasp the process of opening, reading, and closing files in an operating system, as well as how they are interpreted by a programming language for subsequent analysis. Mastering this task is essential for aspiring programmers as a significant portion of their work involves manipulating files for data management and persistence. The main objective of this project is to implement a function that retrieves one line at a time from a text file.
